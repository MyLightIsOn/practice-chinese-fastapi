# Database Optimization Summary

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Added Indexes for Frequently Searched Columns
- Created an index for simplified characters: `idx_simplified`
- Created an index for traditional characters: `idx_traditional`
- Created an index for pinyin: `idx_pinyin`

These indexes will significantly speed up queries that filter or search by these columns. SQLite will use these indexes to quickly locate matching rows without having to scan the entire table.

### 2. Implemented Full-Text Search (FTS) for English Definitions
- Created an FTS5 virtual table: `fts_english_definitions`
- Populated the FTS table with data from the `english_definitions` column

Full-Text Search provides much faster and more efficient text searching capabilities compared to LIKE queries, especially for longer text fields like definitions. It also enables more advanced search features like relevance ranking and tokenization.

### 3. Switched from LIKE Queries to Exact Matches Where Appropriate
- Modified the lookup function to support both exact matches and contains matches
- Added a `match_type` parameter to allow users to specify which type of match they want
- Added a `search_field` parameter to allow users to specify which field they want to search

Exact matches are much faster than LIKE queries with wildcards because they can take full advantage of indexes. The API now supports both types of matches, allowing users to choose the appropriate one for their needs.

## Expected Impact

### Performance Improvements
- **Faster Queries**: All searches should be significantly faster, especially for exact matches and English definition searches.
- **Reduced Database Load**: More efficient queries mean less CPU and I/O usage on the database server.
- **Better Scalability**: The optimizations will help the system handle more concurrent users and larger datasets.

### Functionality Improvements
- **More Flexible Searching**: Users can now specify which field to search and whether to use exact or contains matching.
- **Better Text Search**: Full-Text Search provides more relevant results for English definition searches.

## Future Considerations
- The test script (`test_optimizations.py`) can be used to measure the performance improvements and verify that the optimizations are working as expected.
- Additional optimizations from the `optimizations.txt` file (Query Improvements, Response Enhancements, and Performance Considerations) can be implemented in the future to further improve the system.
